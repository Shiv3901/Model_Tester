# The process can be divided into 3 parts:

# Part 1: 

    # - Open up the Traffic_model.nlogo file in Netlogo
    # - Then open BehaviourTool to start the testing
    # - Decide the variable and name the data file

# Part 2:

    # - Open the .csv file generated from Netlogo
    # - Delete line 21, 14 and 1 to 6 to get it suitable for python to read

# Part 3: 

    # - Start a jupyter notebook session
    # - Import Generate class from the tools_ package
    # - Pass all the correct and required arguments to the class
    # - Call the function to generate the plots that you require

# ENJOY and Let me know what you think about it :))
